Place your YOLOv11 weights files here with the following naming convention:
- best_nano.pt   (YOLOv11 Nano model)
- best_small.pt  (YOLOv11 Small model)
- best_medium.pt (YOLOv11 Medium model)

You can also keep the original files:
- best.pt (default model)
- last.pt (last checkpoint)

Do NOT commit or upload large model files to version control.

To download YOLOv11 pretrained models:
- You can train your own model using Ultralytics
- Or use pretrained models from Ultralytics (yolo11n.pt, yolo11s.pt, yolo11m.pt)
- Rename them to match the naming convention above
